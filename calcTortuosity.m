function tortuosity = calcTortuosity(tpRange,pathLen)
% calcTortuosity: calculate tortuosity of a trajectory
% *: Tortuosity was calculated as the integral of square of derivative of 
%       curvature, divided by the length of a curve. 
%    Intuitively, this formulation describes the degree to which the 
%       curvature of a trajectory changes relatively to its length. 
%    This formulation establishes that the tortuosity of a circle or a straight line is zero.
